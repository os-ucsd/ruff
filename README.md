## Flashcards made faster.
No more wasting time making flashcards for your exam tomorrow. Simply upload your notes as text or a PDF file and get your flashcards in an instant.

The process of making flashcards have largely remained the same for decades - Manually writing the questions and then the answers on it flipside. With the power of Natural Language Processing, Ruff automates this process to save hours and hours of tedious busywork.

  - Technology stack: Python, NLTK, spaCy, Streamlit, React
  - Status: Initial Version Almost Complete. After implementing animated flashcards, ready for hosting.

## Getting involved
We are currently trying to implement animated flashcards in the webpage using bi-directional Streamlit components. React components are required for this purpose and we would appreciate any help for implementing this.

As we move on with this project, we are planning to implement downloading of flashcards along with user login features and saving flashcards in personal accounts. Check out how you can [CONTRIBUTE](CONTRIBUTING.md) to our project.

## Credits and references
Anki, the flashcard making software used by millions, is our major inspiration for Ruff. Their clean UI and functionality will be a tough act to follow.
